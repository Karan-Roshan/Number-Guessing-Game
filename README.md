# ----- Number Guessing Game (JAVA) -----


# Project Description
The Number Guessing Game is a simple Java-based console game where players try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. Players receive hints after each guess to guide them toward the correct number. The game also provides a limited number of attempts and allows users to replay after completing a round.


#  How It Works?
1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
2. The player enters a guess.
3. The game provides hints:
    - “Correct! You got it!” → If the guess is right
    - “Super Close! Try again.” → If the guess is very close (within 3)
    - “Getting Closer! Keep going.” → If the guess is somewhat close (within 10)
    - “Way Off! Try a different number.” → If the guess is far from the actual number
4. The player gets only 10 attempts to guess the number.
5. If the player fails to guess within 10 attempts, the game reveals the correct number.
6. The player can choose to play again after each round.
